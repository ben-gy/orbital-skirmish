/**
 * rematch.test.ts — the multi-race protocol, driven with N simulated peers.
 * A "round" here is one live race over a shared course seed.
 *
 * What this covers and what it deliberately does not:
 *
 *  - COVERED: our round protocol. Votes, quorum, monotonic round numbers, the
 *    frozen roster, host election, host handover mid-results. This is our logic
 *    and a fake bus exercises it honestly.
 *
 *  - NOT COVERED: the transport bug that started all this. A fake bus sits ABOVE
 *    Trystero's room cache, so it structurally cannot contain that defect and
 *    would happily go green while the real game was broken. Two other tests own
 *    that: trystero-rejoin.test.ts pins the Trystero behaviour itself, and the
 *    "one join per session" case below asserts the invariant that makes the trap
 *    unreachable — no network model required.
